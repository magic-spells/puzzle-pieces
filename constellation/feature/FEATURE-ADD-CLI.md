# The add CLI — resolver + copier

**Status: SHIPPED 2026-07-17 — as `puzzle add piece <name…>` in the Puzzle Go CLI** (framework-CLI integration chosen over a standalone npm package; there is no `@magic-spells/puzzle-pieces` npm package and none is planned). Lives in `../puzzle/compiler/internal/pieces/` + `add.go`, with 22 Go tests, verified end-to-end against this registry (button; date-picker → calendar + `lib/date-math.js` transitively; conflict refusal; consumer app builds with pieces + morph-engine). Because the repo is registry-shaped ([[DECISION-REGISTRY-SHAPED-REPO]]) the CLI is a pure resolver + file-copier, never a build tool.

## Shipped contract (what this registry must stay compatible with)

1. **Registry source chain:** `--registry <path|url>` flag → `PUZZLE_PIECES_REGISTRY` env var → default `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magic-spells/puzzle-pieces/main/registry`. The default URL goes live the moment this repo is public — that IS the publish ([[RELEASE-V0-1-0]]).
2. Reads `registry.json`; resolves requested pieces **plus `registryDependencies` transitively** (dedupe). Pieces → `app/components/ui/`, `lib/*.js` → `app/lib/`.
3. **Refuses to overwrite an existing target unless `--overwrite`** — all-or-nothing pre-flight.
4. **Prints — never auto-runs — the npm install** for accumulated `dependencies` (e.g. `@magic-spells/morph-engine`). Never rewrites user files (Puzzle D3 precedent: print snippets).
5. **Theme is copied like a piece:** `theme/pieces.css` is written verbatim to `app/styles/pieces.css` (+ lock entry) when the app has neither the tokens nor the file, and the one-line `@import './pieces.css';` wiring step is printed (styles.css is user-owned). Detection keys on the `puzzle-pieces design tokens` header comment / a `pieces.css` reference in styles.css — **don't reword that comment without updating the CLI's marker.**
6. **No header stamps** — copies stay byte-identical to the registry (diffable). `pieces.lock` at the consumer app root records **sha256 content hashes** per piece/lib (hashes, not versions, so nothing needs bumping) enabling a future `diff`/`update` to distinguish upstream-changed from locally-customized.

## Remaining follow-ups

- Docs pages for the CLI flow (in the demo docs site or the future Astro docs).
- The `diff`/`update` command built on `pieces.lock`.
